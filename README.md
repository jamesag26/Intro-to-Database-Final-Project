# Intro-to-Database-Final-Project

This project was for my Intro to Database class. It involved creating a basic store website which a user can use to interact with a database of items in the inventory. A user can be either a customer or a staff member or manager. Depending on the user the database can be interacted with in different ways. A customer can add items to a cart and create an order, while a staff member can add items to the inventory, change the amount of items in stock or ship out orders. This project was focused on interacting with a database so website security with user password and other more advanced website features were left out of this project. 
This project contains all php and html files that were used to interact with the database. The database is no longer setup but the details of it can be found in the report file included in this project. The database was setup and was interacted with using mysql.
