Objectives
The aim of this project is to implement an e-commerce database application. You are responsible for client-side web applications and setting up the server-side database. Let’s assume that you have been hired to set up an online gift store. The company sells two types of products: books and games.

Requirements

Your goal is to create an online store for the gift store. There will be three types of users:
customers
staff
manager
 
Customers They are allowed to query items in the stores at all times. But in order to purchase from the store, customers must first register. The items are first placed in a shopping basket, and then ordered. Customers can see the status of orders (i.e., pending or shipped) as part of the shopping history.

Staff can check inventory, re-stock the online store with more items, view all customer orders, and ship orders to customers. A staff member has an on-line ID and a password that he/she can use to login into the company’s website to perform the previous listed tasks

Manager can do all tasks a staff member can do. In addition, manager can (1) view statistics about sale information (in the previous week, month, or year), and (2) decide sales promotions. Manager needs to login into the company’s website to perform the tasks.

 
Your project must include the following functionality:
Customer Forms
Register Allows a new customer to register with the store.
Shopping Allows a registered customer to view and search items and add items into a shopping basket.
Purchase Allows a registered customer to view their shopping basket and click "Purchase". This creates an order for the items that can then be viewed (and filled) by the store staff.  
Orders Allows a registered customer to view the orders they have placed and see the status (either Pending or Shipped).
 
Staff Forms
Login Screen Staff must login in order to perform these functions. A single login for all staff is fine.
View Inventory See a list of all items and their quantity.
Update Inventory Same as above, but with editable text boxes to change the quantity of any component.
Ship Pending Orders View the list of pending orders (components, price, customer info).
The staff member can click a "Ship It" button and, if all the components are available, the status of the order changes from "Pending" to "Shipped" and the quantities in the inventory are decreased. If the components are not available, some error page listing the missing components is generated and the order remains "Pending".

Manager Forms
Login Screen may use the staff login form
View Inventory, Update Inventory, Ship Pending Orders: the same as those of staff
Sales Statistics View the list of all items and sales history in the previous (week, month, or year)
Sales Promotion View the list of all items and decide the promotion rate.
